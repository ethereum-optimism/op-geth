    This is an overview of the changes in [`op-geth`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth),
    a fork of [`go-ethereum`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), part of the OP-stack.

    The OP-stack architecture is modular, following the Consensus/Execution split of post-Merge Ethereum L1:

      - [`op-node`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-node) implements most rollup-specific functionality as Consensus-Layer, similar to a L1 beacon-node. 
      - [`op-geth`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth) implements the Execution-Layer, with **minimal changes** for a secure Ethereum-equivalent application environment.

    Related [op-stack specifications](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/specs):

              description: |
                The Bedrock upgrade introduces a `Deposit` transaction-type (`0x7E`) to enable both users and the
                rollup system itself to change the L2 state based on L1 events and system rules as
                [specified](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/deposits.md).

              description: |
                The `Transaction` type now exposes the deposit-transaction and L1-cost properties required for the rollup.

              description: |
                Transactions must pay an additional L1 cost based on the amount of rollup-data-gas they consume,
                estimated based on gas-price-oracle information and encoded tx size."

            - title: Transaction processing
              description: |
                Deposit transactions have special processing rules: gas is pre-paid on L1,
                and deposits with EVM-failure are included with rolled back changes (except mint).
                For regular transactions, at the end of the transition, the 1559 burn and L1 cost are routed to vaults.

            - title: "Gaslimit"
              description: |
                The gaslimit is free to be set by the Engine API caller, instead of enforcing adjustments of the
                gaslimit in increments of 1/1024 of the previous gaslimit.
                The gaslimit is changed (and limited) through the `SystemConfig` contract.

              description: |
                The Engine API is activated at the Merge transition, with a Total Terminal Difficulty (TTD).
                The rollup starts post-merge, and thus sets the TTD to 0.

            The rollup functionality is enabled with the `optimism` field in the chain config.
            The EIP-1559 parameters are configurable to adjust for faster more frequent and smaller blocks.
            The parameters can be overriden for testing.

          description: |
            The optimism Goerli testnet used clique-config data to make geth internals accept blocks.
            Post-bedrock the beacon-consensus (i.e. follow Engine API) is now used, and the clique config is removed.

        - title: "Engine API modifications"
          description: |
            The Engine API is extended to insert transactions into the block and optionally exclude the tx-pool,
            to reproduce the exact block of the sequencer from just the inputs, as derived from L1 by the rollup-node.

                  - The tx pool propagation can be enabled/disabled.
